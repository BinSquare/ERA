## 🚀 KISS Recommendation (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

If you’re building your **first or simple Python agent**, do this:

1. **Start with LangChain.** It’s well-documented, widely used, and gives you everything (tools, memory, APIs, etc.) to get going.
2. **If you want simpler** (no frameworks, no chains): use SmolAgents or just a simple Python script that calls OpenAI API + your custom logic.
3. **Scale later** — if you add more agents or want them to collaborate, move to AutoGen or CrewAI.
4. **For enterprise integration**, Semantic Kernel is the right direction.

## 🧩 Simple LangChain Agent Example (Minimal)

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

response = agent.run("What is the square root of 245, and search for a nearby coffee shop?")
print(response)
```

This gives you a minimal yet functional **agent** with reasoning, external tools, and LLM-powered steps — no extra clutter.

## 🔮 Final Notes

- Most of these frameworks are LLM-oriented. If you’re building rule-based or classical AI agents (not LLM), frameworks like **Mesa** (multi-agent simulation) or **spade** (multi-agent systems) might fit better.
- Don’t over-engineer. The goal: get something working, then modularize later.
- Once your prototype works, **add memory, retrieval, or orchestration only when necessary.**
